			<h3 id="title">What is Yoga?</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle
				science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. It is
				an art and science of healthy living. The word 'Yoga' is derived from
				the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'.

			    <h3 id="warm-up">Warming Up</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    Warming up before yoga is critical. It raises your bodily temperature,
				    which is great for your muscles. They become more limber and more
				    susceptible to the benefits of yoga.
			    </p>
			    <br />
			    <h3>Goddess Pose</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    Goddess pose is an essential yoga warmup pose, because it works on your
				    lower body and your core. More specifically, whenever you do goddess
				    pose, your calves, quadriceps, and glutes are all active as well as your
				    abs.
			    </p>
			    <br />
			    <h3>Downward Facing Dog</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    You're probably most familiar with this exercise. This is one of the
				    most popular warmup poses for yoga, and it's also great to do before any
				    physical activity. Downward facing dog is perfect for stretching your
				    entire backside. However, the stretch is also great for developing
				    strength in your wrists and muscles. One important area downward facing
				    dog stretches is the ankles, which allows for more foot mobility when
				    stretching.
			    </p>
                <br />
			    <h3>Child's Pose</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    You're probably also familiar with child pose. It's a common yoga pose
				    that is used for both warming up and relaxing the muscles in between
				    workouts. The main reason this is such a great yoga warmup pose is that
				    it increases blood circulation and relieves stress. On top of this, the
				    child's pose is great for stimulating blood flow to the pelvic organs
				    and stretching your back. This will allow for a wider range of movements
				    while also providing things like tailbone pain relief.
			    </p>
			    <br />
                <h3>Eagle Pose</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    Eagle pose is great for improving balance and posture. This stretch
				    helps open your hips and promotes deeper breathing overall. One area
				    that eagle pose also opens is the shoulders.
			    </p>
			    <br />
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6">
			    <h3 id="needle-pose">Eye of the Needle Pose</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    We recommend using the eye of the needle pose for warming up both your
				    upper and lower body. This stretch is also great for increasing mobility
				    since most of the muscles eye of the needle works on can tighten up
				    during workouts.
			    </p>
			    <br />
			    <h3>Practice Warm-up Poses Today</h3>
			    <br />
			    <p>
				    We've shown you five of our favorite yoga warmup poses. Each pose is
				    great for warming up certain parts of your body. However, there's one
				    thing in common that all five poses have: increasing mobility. These
				    warmup poses will help your muscles move more fluidly. Therefore, you'll
				    be less prone to injury. Next time you go to the studio, we recommend
				    practicing some of these poses.
